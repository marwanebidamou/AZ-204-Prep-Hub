## Redis Cache Use Cases

### 1. **Data Caching**
- **Example**: Store frequently accessed data like API responses, headers, footers, or banners.
- **Benefit**: Reduce API calls, improve performance, and minimize latency.

### 2. **Session Store**
- **Example**: Maintain session state, such as shopping carts or user interactions, without relying on traditional session variables.
- **Benefit**: Offload session management to Redis for scalability and speed.

### 3. **Real-Time Analytics**
- **Example**: Process and store high-frequency, time-sensitive data.
- **Benefit**: Leverage Redis’s low-latency performance for real-time insights.

## Azure Cache for Redis SKU Tiers

### Overview
Azure Cache for Redis offers various SKUs tailored to different workloads. Each tier provides unique features and pricing:

| **Tier**      | **VMs**              | **SLA**    | **Features**                               | **Use Cases**                                      |
|---------------|----------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic**     | Single VM           | No SLA     | No clustering, no persistence              | Development, testing, non-critical workloads     |
| **Standard**  | Two VMs (replicated)| Yes        | Replication, no clustering                 | Moderate workloads with replication             |
| **Premium**   | Powerful VMs        | Yes        | Clustering, persistence, geo-replication   | High-performance, mission-critical workloads    |
| **Enterprise**| Redis Enterprise    | Yes        | Redis modules: Search, JSON, Time Series   | Advanced workloads requiring extended features  |
| **Enterprise Flash** | Redis Enterprise + Flash Memory | Yes | Non-volatile memory for persistence       | Large-scale, data-intensive workloads           |

## SKU Features and Comparison

### **Basic Tier**
- Single VM, no SLA.
- No replication, clustering, or persistence.
- Ideal for development and testing environments where data loss is acceptable.

### **Standard Tier**
- Two VMs in replicated configuration.
- SLA guaranteed.
- No clustering or data persistence.
- Suitable for small to medium workloads requiring fault tolerance.

### **Premium Tier**
- Multiple advanced features:
  - **Clustering**: Distribute data across nodes for scalability.
  - **Persistence**: Save data to disk for recovery after restarts.
  - **Geo-replication (Passive)**: Replicate data across regions.
  - **Audit Logs**: Track connections and operations.
  - **Import/Export**: Move data in and out of the cache.
- Best for mission-critical applications requiring high performance.

### **Enterprise Tier**
- Redis Enterprise software.
- Includes Redis modules:
  - **Search**: Full-text search capabilities.
  - **Bloom**: Probabilistic data structures.
  - **JSON**: Store and manipulate JSON data.
  - **Time Series**: Efficiently store and query time-series data.
- Designed for advanced workloads leveraging Redis’ extended functionality.

### **Enterprise Flash Tier**
- Builds on Enterprise Tier with non-volatile Flash memory.
- Data persists even if the instance is restarted.
- Optimized for large-scale, data-intensive applications.

---

## Capacity Guidelines
- **Basic**: Up to 250 MB.
- **Standard**: Up to 5 GB.
- **Premium**: Supports up to 100 GB or more.
- **Enterprise & Flash**: Higher capacities for enterprise-scale workloads.

## Choosing the Right SKU
When deciding on the appropriate SKU:

1. **Workload Criticality**:
   - Use Basic for non-critical tasks.
   - Opt for Premium or Enterprise for mission-critical applications.

2. **Capacity Needs**:
   - Evaluate storage requirements. E.g., storing 10 GB requires Premium tier or above.

3. **Feature Requirements**:
   - Consider features like clustering, persistence, and replication.

4. **Budget**:
   - Balance cost against performance and feature needs.

Azure Cache for Redis provides a flexible range of tiers to support applications ranging from basic development to enterprise-grade workloads with advanced caching requirements.
