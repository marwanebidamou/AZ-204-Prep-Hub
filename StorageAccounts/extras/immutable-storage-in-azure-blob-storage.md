# Immutable Storage in Azure Blob Storage

Azure Blob Storage supports **immutable storage** to ensure data integrity and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. This feature enables users to write data once and protect it from being modified or deleted for a specified retention period.

---

## **1. Key Features of Immutable Storage**
- **Write Once, Read Many (WORM)**: Ensures that data, once written, cannot be modified or deleted.
- **Compliance and Legal Hold**:
  - Retain blobs for a defined period using time-based retention policies.
  - Apply legal holds to prevent data deletion until the hold is removed.
- **Immutable Policies**:
  - Protect data even from users with account-level permissions.

---

## **2. Use Cases**
1. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - Financial records, healthcare data, and other data requiring retention policies.
2. **Audit and Log Data**:
   - Ensure audit trails remain intact for future reviews.
3. **Backup and Archiving**:
   - Immutable backups to guard against accidental or malicious deletion.

---

## **3. Retention Policy Options**
Azure Blob Storage supports the following immutable policies:

### **a. Time-Based Retention Policy**
- Set a specific retention period (in days) during which data cannot be modified or deleted.
- Example:
```bash
az storage container immutability-policy set \
  --account-name <storage_account_name> \
  --container-name <container_name> \
  --policy-period <retention_days>
```

### **b. Legal Hold**
- Prevent deletion of blobs until the legal hold is explicitly removed.
- Example:
```bash
az storage container legal-hold set \
  --account-name <storage_account_name> \
  --container-name <container_name> \
  --tags <legal_hold_tag>
```

---

## **4. How to Enable Immutable Storage**

### **a. Configure an Immutable Blob Storage Container**
1. **Azure Portal**:
   - Navigate to your storage account and select the blob container.
   - Enable "Immutable storage with versioning."
   - Define a retention policy or apply a legal hold.

2. **Azure CLI**:
   - Use the following command to enable immutable storage:
   ```bash
   az storage account blob-service-properties update \
     --account-name <storage_account_name> \
     --enable-immutability true \
     --enable-versioning true
   ```

### **b. Set Up a Time-Based Retention Policy**
- Use the Azure CLI or ARM templates to define the retention period.
- Example ARM Template snippet:
```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers",
  "apiVersion": "2021-04-01",
  "properties": {
    "immutableStorageWithVersioning": {
      "enabled": true,
      "immutabilityPolicy": {
        "immutabilityPeriodSinceCreationInDays": 365,
        "state": "Locked"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## **5. Immutable Storage Best Practices**
- **Versioning**: Enable versioning to ensure you can recover data if a policy is removed.
- **Data Planning**: Plan retention periods carefully as WORM policies cannot be shortened once locked.
- **Monitoring and Auditing**: Use Azure Monitor to track policy changes and access.
- **Legal Holds**: Use descriptive tags for easy identification and management of legal holds.

---

## **6. Limitations and Considerations**
- Immutable storage is only supported for **block blobs**.
- Retention policies cannot be shortened once locked but can be extended.
- The feature is not available for **page blobs** or **append blobs**.

---

## **7. Tools and References**
1. **Azure CLI**:
   - Manage immutability: `az storage container immutability-policy`.
   - Manage legal holds: `az storage container legal-hold`.
2. **Azure Portal**:
   - GUI for enabling and configuring immutable storage.
3. **Documentation**:

By implementing immutable storage policies in Azure Blob Storage, you can safeguard critical data, achieve regulatory compliance, and protect against accidental or malicious changes.
