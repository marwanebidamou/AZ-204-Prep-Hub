# Azure Storage Accounts: Networking, Data Protection, and Encryption Settings

This document provides a detailed overview of networking, data protection, and encryption settings available in Azure Storage Accounts. These settings enhance security, optimize performance, and ensure compliance.

## Networking Settings

Azure Storage Accounts offer robust networking options to control and secure access to your storage resources.

### Access Options
1. **Public Network Access:**
   - **Enabled (default):** Allows public access to the storage account.
   - **Disabled:** Blocks all public access, limiting access to private endpoints.

2. **Private Endpoint:**
   - Integrates with Azure Private Link to provide private connectivity.
   - Ensures access to storage accounts via private IP addresses within your virtual network.

3. **Firewall and Virtual Networks:**
   - Enable access restrictions based on IP ranges or Azure Virtual Networks.
   - Configure a **Firewall** to allow or deny traffic from specific IP ranges.

   Example CLI Command:
   ```bash
   az storage account network-rule add \
     --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
     --account-name <storage-account-name> \
     --ip-address <IP-range>
   ```

### Routing Preferences
- Choose the **Microsoft Global Network** for lower latency and high availability.
- Use **Internet Routing** for cost optimization but with slightly higher latency.

### Secure Transfer
- **Enable HTTPS Only:** Ensures secure communication with storage accounts over REST API.
- CLI Example:
  ```bash
  az storage account update \
    --name <storage-account-name> \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --https-only true
  ```

## Data Protection Settings

Azure Storage provides multiple features to safeguard your data against accidental deletion, corruption, or loss.

### Soft Delete
1. **Blob Soft Delete:**
   - Protects blob data from accidental deletion.
   - Deleted blobs are retained for a configurable period (e.g., 7 days).

   CLI Example:
   ```bash
   az storage blob service-properties delete-policy update \
     --account-name <storage-account-name> \
     --days-retained <retention-days> \
     --enable true
   ```

2. **Container Soft Delete:**
   - Similar to blob soft delete but applies to entire containers.

3. **File Share Soft Delete:**
   - Recovers deleted Azure Files shares within the retention period.

### Versioning
- Automatically saves and tracks multiple versions of an object for recovery.

### Immutable Storage
- Provides **Write Once, Read Many (WORM)** policies to prevent data modification or deletion during a specified retention period.

### Cross-Region Replication
- Configure **Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)** or **Geo-Zone Redundant Storage (GZRS)** for disaster recovery.
- Enable **Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)** for secondary read access during outages.

## Encryption Settings

Azure Storage encrypts data at rest and in transit, ensuring confidentiality and compliance.

### Encryption at Rest
1. **Microsoft-Managed Keys (default):**
   - Azure manages the encryption keys.
   - No configuration is needed by the user.

2. **Customer-Managed Keys (CMK):**
   - Users manage their encryption keys in Azure Key Vault.
   - CLI Example:
     ```bash
     az storage account encryption-scope create \
       --name <encryption-scope-name> \
       --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
       --account-name <storage-account-name> \
       --key-source Microsoft.Keyvault \
       --key-uri <key-vault-key-uri>
     ```

3. **Double Encryption:**
   - Adds an extra layer of encryption for enhanced security.

### Encryption in Transit
- Data transfer is encrypted using HTTPS.
- Enable SMB protocol encryption for Azure Files.

### Key Rotation
- Rotate customer-managed keys regularly to enhance security.
- CLI Example:
  ```bash
  az keyvault key rotate \
    --vault-name <key-vault-name> \
    --name <key-name>
  ```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Restrict Access to a Specific Network
- Use Private Endpoints and disable public access.
- Configure a firewall with specific IP address ranges.

### Scenario 2: Set Up Geo-Redundant Storage
- Enable GRS or RA-GRS for disaster recovery.
- Use data replication to a paired Azure region.

### Scenario 3: Protect Data with Versioning and Soft Delete
- Enable blob versioning and configure soft delete for both blobs and containers.
- Use immutable storage for compliance with regulatory requirements.
