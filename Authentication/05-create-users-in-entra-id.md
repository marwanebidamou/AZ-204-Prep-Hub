# Creating Users in Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)

Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) allows you to create and manage users within your organizationâ€™s tenant. These users can authenticate to applications and services integrated with Entra ID.

## Steps to Create Users in Entra ID

### 1. **Creating a New User**
A **new user** is a full member of the tenant and has permissions based on their assigned roles and groups.

#### Steps:
1. Navigate to the **Users** section in the Entra ID portal.
2. Click on `+ New User` and select `Create User`.
3. Fill in the required details:
   - **User Name**: This will follow the default domain name (e.g., `john.doe@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com`).
   - **Name**: Provide the user's full name.
   - **Password**: You can auto-generate or set a custom password.
4. (Optional) Assign the user to specific groups or roles.
5. Click `Create` to complete the process.

#### Example:
Creating a user named John Doe:
- **User Name**: `john.doe@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com`
- **Password**: Auto-generated.

### 2. **Creating a Guest User**
A **guest user** is an external user invited to join the tenant. Guest users are ideal for collaboration with external partners or contractors.

#### Steps:
1. Navigate to the **Users** section in the Entra ID portal.
2. Click on `+ New User` and select `Invite User`.
3. Provide the external user's email address (e.g., `sally.doe@example.com`).
4. (Optional) Add a personal invitation message.
5. Click `Invite` to send the email invitation.

#### Key Features of Guest Users:
- Guest users receive an invitation email to join the tenant.
- Guest accounts are labeled as **Guest** in the directory.
- Guest users may have limited permissions compared to tenant members.
- Guest accounts are not synchronized with on-premises Active Directory.

## Managing Created Users

1. **Assigning Roles and Groups**:
   - Users can be added to specific roles (e.g., developer, HR administrator) and groups.
   - Roles determine permissions within the tenant.

2. **Monitoring and Auditing**:
   - Use **Access Reviews** to periodically review and validate user access, especially for guest users.

## Example Use Case

- **Internal User**: John Doe is created as a full member of the tenant with access to specific internal resources.
- **External Guest**: Sally Doe is invited as a guest to collaborate on a shared project. She receives an email, registers her account, and gains limited access to tenant resources.

## Best Practices for Managing Users

1. **Strong Passwords**: Auto-generate passwords to enforce security.
2. **Guest User Reviews**: Regularly review guest user access to ensure it remains relevant.
3. **Custom Domains**: Configure a custom domain (e.g., `@companyname.com`) for a professional user experience.
4. **Role-Based Access**: Assign roles to limit permissions and reduce security risks.

## Next Steps

With users created in your tenant, you can proceed to integrate authentication into your applications. For example:
- John Doe can log into a web application using Entra ID authentication.
- Guest users like Sally can access shared resources securely.
