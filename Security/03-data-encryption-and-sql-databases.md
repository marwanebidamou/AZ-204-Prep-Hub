# Data Encryption in SQL Databases

Azure provides robust encryption features for its SQL databases, ensuring data security both in transit and at rest. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at these encryption options.

---

## 1. Encryption in Transit

### Overview
Encryption in transit ensures that data traveling between a client and the SQL database is secure. This is typically achieved through TLS (Transport Layer Security).

### Configuration Options
- **TLS Version**:
  - Default: **TLS 1.2**
  - Other versions (TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0) are deprecated and should only be used for legacy systems.
- **Connection Encryption Setting**:
  - Enabled by default for all connections.
  - Can be verified and enforced through the SQL Server configuration.

### Benefits
- Prevents data interception during transmission.
- Ensures compliance with security standards.

## 2. Encryption at Rest

### Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- **Default Setting**:
  - Enabled by default for all Azure SQL databases and Managed Instances.
- **Key Management Options**:
  - **Service-Managed Keys**:
    - Keys managed by Microsoft.
    - Simplifies setup and maintenance.
  - **Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs)**:
    - Stored in Azure Key Vault.
    - Provides full control over encryption keys.

### Server-Level vs Database-Level Encryption
- **Server-Level Encryption**:
  - Default for all databases under a SQL server.
  - Provides a unified encryption standard.
- **Database-Level Encryption**:
  - Overrides server-level settings for specific databases.
  - Allows custom encryption configurations for individual databases.

## 3. Advanced Encryption: Always Encrypted

### Overview
Always Encrypted ensures end-to-end encryption, where data is encrypted at the client side and only decrypted at the client side. Even database administrators cannot access plaintext data.

### Key Features
- **Encryption Keys**:
  - Stored securely on the client-side or in a Key Vault.
  - Not accessible by the Azure SQL Database.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Highly sensitive data such as Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and credit card information.
- **Configuration**:
  - Define columns in a table that require encryption.
  - Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or PowerShell to configure.

### Benefits
- Provides maximum security for sensitive data.
- Meets strict compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR).

## 4. Backup and Encryption

### Default Backup Encryption
- All backups (full, differential, transaction log) are encrypted if TDE is enabled.

### Custom Backup Encryption
- Use a specific encryption key for backup data.
- Consider unencrypted backups for legacy systems or offline storage.

## 5. Infrastructure Encryption

### Overview
A second layer of encryption over TDE to protect data at rest.

### Benefits
- Provides additional security for high-value or regulated data.
- Protects against hardware compromise.

## Best Practices for SQL Database Encryption

1. **Use Customer-Managed Keys**:
   - For organizations with strict security policies, store keys in Azure Key Vault.
2. **Enable Always Encrypted for Sensitive Data**:
   - Encrypt specific columns to protect personally identifiable information (PII).
3. **Audit Encryption Usage**:
   - Regularly monitor encryption settings and access logs.
4. **Stay Updated**:
   - Use the latest TLS version to ensure encryption in transit remains secure.
5. **Test Backups**:
   - Ensure backup data can be restored successfully with the correct keys.
