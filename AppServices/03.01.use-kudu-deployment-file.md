# Using `.deployment` for Kudu-Based Deployments

## Overview
The `.deployment` file is a powerful tool used in **Azure App Services** to customize the deployment process when using the **Kudu deployment engine**. Kudu is the **engine behind Azure App Service deployments**. It provides:

1. **Deployment Services**:
   - Automatically deploy code from source control systems like GitHub, Azure Repos, or Bitbucket.
   - Supports custom deployment scripts for more complex workflows.

2. **Build Automation**:
   - Handles language-specific build steps, such as restoring packages, building applications, and running tests.

3. **Diagnostics**:
   - Offers logs and debugging tools to monitor and troubleshoot deployments.

4. **Extensions and Tools**:
   - Provides a built-in console, file explorer, and Git hooks for advanced customization.

This tutorial explains how to configure a `.deployment` file to leverage Kudu's capabilities for your Azure App Service deployments. It includes setup steps, examples, and best practices

## Steps to Add `.deployment`

### 1. Create the `.deployment` File
- Place a file named `.deployment` in the **root of your repository**.

### 2. Configure the `.deployment` File
Example content for a `.deployment` file:
```ini
[config]
command = deploy.cmd
```
- The `command` field specifies the custom deployment script to execute (e.g., `deploy.cmd` or `deploy.sh`).

### 3. Create the Deployment Script
- Add a deployment script in the same directory or a designated folder (e.g., `Setup/`).

Example `deploy.cmd` for Node.js:
```cmd
echo "Running custom deployment script"
npm install
npm run build
```

For Linux-based apps, you can use a `deploy.sh` script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running custom deployment script"
npm install
npm run build
```
Ensure the script is executable by running `chmod +x deploy.sh`.

## Why Use `.deployment`?

### Benefits
1. **Override Default Behavior**:
   - Customize the deployment pipeline beyond the defaults provided by Kudu.

2. **Support Multi-Step Deployments**:
   - Run additional tasks like installing dependencies, building the app, or running database migrations.

3. **Integration with Azure Pipelines**:
   - Ensure consistent deployments across CI/CD and manual processes.

### Use Cases
- Applications requiring custom build steps.
- Multi-language projects needing specific runtime configurations.
- Advanced deployment scenarios such as static website generation or containerized builds.

## Additional Notes

### Best Practices
- **Store Scripts in Source Control**:
  Include deployment scripts in the repository to ensure repeatable and traceable deployments.

- **Test Locally**:
  Verify custom deployment scripts work locally before pushing them to Azure.

- **Secure Scripts**:
  Avoid including sensitive information (e.g., credentials) directly in the deployment scripts.

### Exam Tip
The `.deployment` file and its role in customizing deployments may appear as part of questions on **Azure App Services** and **CI/CD pipelines** in the AZ-204 exam.
