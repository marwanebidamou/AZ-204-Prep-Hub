# Configuring Azure API Management

Azure API Management (APIM) provides tools to manage, secure, and expose APIs. It acts as an intermediary between API consumers and backend services, offering features such as access control, rate limiting, and monitoring. This document walks through the process of configuring an API Management instance and setting up APIs.

## Steps to Configure API Management

### 1. **Create an API Management Service Instance**

#### Navigate to the Azure Marketplace
- Search for **API Management** and select it.

#### Provide Basic Information
- **Subscription**: Select the subscription to associate with the instance.
- **Resource Group**: Choose or create a resource group.
- **Name**: Provide a unique name for the instance.
- **Region**: Select the deployment region closest to your API consumers.
- **Organization Name**: This name appears in the Developer Portal.
- **Administrator Email**: Enter the contact email for managing the instance.

#### Choose a Pricing Tier
- **Developer**: Suitable for development and testing (no SLA).
- **Basic**: Entry-level production tier.
- **Standard**: For medium-scale production use.
- **Premium**: High-scale production with advanced features (e.g., multi-region).
- **Consumption**: Serverless, pay-as-you-go option.

#### Configure Additional Settings
- **Application Insights**: Enable for telemetry and performance tracking.
- **Virtual Network Integration**: For advanced networking setups (premium tier required).
- **HTTP/2 and TLS Settings**: Enhance security and performance.

#### Review and Create
- Validate settings and deploy the instance. Note that deployment may take up to two hours.

### 2. **Explore the API Management Service**

Once the instance is created:
- **Developer Portal**:
  - Accessible via a provided URL.
  - Displays API documentation and allows developers to sign up and test APIs.
- **Gateway URL**:
  - Public endpoint for accessing APIs managed by APIM.
  - Distributes API calls to backend services.

### 3. **Define APIM Products (Subscription Plans)**

- **Products** in Azure API Management serve as containers for APIs and define access control for API consumers.
- **Subscriptions** are associated with products and represent a consumer's access to the APIs within that product.

#### Characteristics of Products:
- Each product can group multiple APIs.
- Products define usage terms, such as rate limits, quotas, and required subscriptions.
- API consumers (developers or teams) subscribe to a product to access its associated APIs.

#### Examples of Products:
- **Starter**:
  - Limited access to APIs, such as a low quota for testing purposes.
  - Can be used as a trial option for new developers.
- **Unlimited**:
  - Provides unrestricted access to APIs.
  - Typically used for premium customers or internal teams.

#### Subscriptions:
- Consumers must subscribe to a product to use its APIs.
- Each subscription generates a **subscription key**, required for API authentication.
- Admins can manage and track subscriptions through the APIM interface.

### 4. **Add and Configure APIs**

#### Import or Create APIs
- **Import Existing APIs**:
  - Use OpenAPI (Swagger) definitions, Azure App Services, or Function Apps.
- **Create New APIs**:
  - Define endpoints, methods, and request/response schemas manually.

#### Configure Policies
- Apply policies at different levels:
  - **Global**: Applies to all APIs.
  - **API-Specific**: Applies to a single API.
  - **Operation-Level**: Applies to specific API operations.
- Example Policies:
  - **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of API calls per minute.
  - **Caching**: Cache responses to reduce backend load.
  - **Transformation**: Rewrite request URLs or modify response formats.

---

### 5. **Monitor and Analyze API Usage**

#### Access Diagnostics
- Use Azure Monitor for:
  - Metrics: View API call counts, response times, and failures.
  - Logs: Analyze detailed request and response data.

#### View Analytics
- Identify top-used APIs and operations.
- Detect performance bottlenecks or excessive usage.

#### Set Alerts
- Configure alerts for:
  - High error rates.
  - Unusual traffic patterns.

---

### 6. **Customize the Developer Portal**

#### Modify Branding
- Add custom logos and themes.
- Update text to match your organizationâ€™s branding.

#### Enable User Sign-Up
- Allow developers to self-register for API keys and subscriptions.

#### Provide Documentation
- Automatically generated from API definitions.
- Enhance with examples, usage guides, and FAQs.

## Summary

Configuring Azure API Management involves setting up an instance, adding APIs, applying policies, and monitoring performance. By leveraging APIM, organizations can ensure secure, scalable, and user-friendly API delivery to developers and partners. Key steps include:

1. Creating an APIM instance.
2. Defining products to group and manage API access.
3. Adding and configuring APIs with appropriate policies.
4. Monitoring API usage and performance.
5. Customizing the Developer Portal for seamless onboarding.

Azure API Management simplifies API lifecycle management, making it an essential tool for modern cloud architectures.
