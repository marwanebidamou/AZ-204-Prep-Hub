# Monitoring Function Events and Errors in Azure Functions

Azure Functions offers powerful tools for monitoring events and debugging errors directly from the Azure portal. This guide provides an overview of key monitoring features and methods to track function invocations, performance, and errors.

## 1. Viewing Recent Function Calls

### Steps:
1. Navigate to the **Invocations** tab within your Azure Function App.
2. View the **20 most recent function calls**:
   - Each invocation includes details such as:
     - **Execution time**
     - **Status** (Success or Failure)
     - **Input/Output logs**

### Benefits:
- Quickly identify anomalies in execution times.
- Analyze the frequency and details of function invocations.

## 2. Using Application Insights

### Enabling Application Insights:
- When creating a Function App, ensure **Application Insights** is enabled for advanced monitoring and analytics.

### Features:
- Detailed telemetry of function invocations.
- Insights into dependencies and failures.
- Rich query and visualization capabilities for monitoring trends.

### Example:
- Use the Application Insights dashboard to:
  - Query logs.
  - Create custom alerts.
  - Visualize invocation patterns and error rates.

## 3. Real-Time Log Streaming

### Accessing Real-Time Logs:
1. Navigate to the **Logs** tab.
2. Connect to the log stream:
   - A live console opens to display real-time execution logs.
   - Blue text indicates active logging during function execution.

### Usage:
- Debug functions as they execute.
- Observe real-time outputs for faster error detection.

### Example Workflow:
1. Refresh the function URL or trigger it manually.
2. Observe the real-time logs for any messages or errors.
3. Return to the code editor to adjust and re-test as needed.

## 4. Logging with `context.log`

### Logging Custom Messages:
- Use `context.log` in your function code to output custom messages to logs.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  module.exports = async function (context, req) {
      context.log('Custom log message: Function execution started.');
      context.log('Request body:', req.body);
      context.res = {
          body: 'Hello from Azure Function!'
      };
  };
  ```

### Monitoring Custom Logs:
- These messages appear in:
  - Historical logs (Monitor tab > Invocation details).
  - Real-time log stream.

---

## 5. Debugging Tips

- **Monitor Tab**:
  - Review invocation history for patterns and recurring errors.
  - Examine execution times for performance bottlenecks.

- **Application Insights**:
  - Query traces and exceptions to pinpoint root causes.
  - Set up alerts for specific error thresholds.

- **Real-Time Logs**:
  - Use during active development to validate changes immediately.
  - Check for unexpected outputs or errors.

---

## 6. Summary

Azure Functions monitoring tools simplify the process of:
- Tracking function invocations.
- Debugging errors with real-time and historical logs.
- Analyzing performance metrics through Application Insights.

By leveraging these features, you can maintain high reliability and performance for your serverless applications.
