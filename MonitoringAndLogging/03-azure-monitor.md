# Azure Monitor Overview

Azure Monitor is a comprehensive platform for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry data from Azure resources and applications. It centralizes diagnostics, metrics, and logs from services such as virtual machines, storage accounts, networks, and databases into a unified interface, enabling efficient monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Key Features of Azure Monitor

### 1. **Diagnostic Settings**
- **Resource Coverage**:
  - Azure Monitor supports diagnostics for a wide range of Azure services, including VMs, storage accounts, networks, SQL databases, and containers.
- **Enabling Diagnostics**:
  - Many Azure services have diagnostic capabilities that are disabled by default.
  - You can enable diagnostics to collect performance metrics, logs, and events.
- **Output Options**:
  - Logs and metrics can be sent to:
    - **Log Analytics Workspace**
    - **Azure Storage Account**
    - **Azure Event Hub** for further processing or integration.

### 2. **Log Analysis**
- **Log Querying**:
  - Use the **Logs** feature to analyze data collected from diagnostics.
  - Queries are written in Kusto Query Language (KQL), a specialized language for querying log data.
- **Scopes and Filters**:
  - Queries can target specific resources, resource groups, or subscriptions.
  - Drill down to granular metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, or network traffic.
- **Predefined Queries**:
  - Azure Monitor includes a library of predefined queries for common scenarios, such as:
    - Identifying top 10 countries accessing an app.
    - CPU usage trends.
    - Disk space availability.

### 3. **Metrics Visualization**
- **Graphs and Dashboards**:
  - Visualize resource performance metrics over time.
  - Set custom time frames and thresholds for detailed analysis.
- **Interactive Metrics**:
  - Example: Monitor CPU percentage of virtual machines over the past 4 hours and identify spikes.

### 4. **Alerts and Notifications**
- **Proactive Monitoring**:
  - Configure alerts based on thresholds, such as high CPU usage or low disk space.
  - Automate responses using Azure Logic Apps or Webhooks.
- **Notification Channels**:
  - Receive alerts via email, SMS, or integrations with third-party services.

### 5. **Dashboards**
- **Custom Dashboards**:
  - Create centralized views for monitoring key metrics across resources.
  - Share dashboards with team members for collaborative monitoring.
- **Application Dashboards**:
  - Automatically generated dashboards for applications integrated with Application Insights.

## Use Case: Monitoring a Virtual Machine

1. **Enable Diagnostics**:
   - Navigate to the VMâ€™s **Monitoring** section in the Azure Portal.
   - Enable diagnostics for:
     - **CPU usage**
     - **Memory usage**
     - **Disk IOPS (read/write)**
     - **Network traffic**
   - Link the diagnostics to a Log Analytics Workspace.

2. **Query Logs**:
   - Use KQL to identify trends and anomalies.
   - Example Query:
     ```
     Heartbeat
     | where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
     | summarize count() by Computer
     ```
     - This query counts the number of heartbeats (health signals) received in the last hour for each VM.

3. **Set Alerts**:
   - Create an alert rule for high CPU usage (>80%).
   - Configure notifications via email or SMS.

4. **Visualize Metrics**:
   - Access the **Metrics** tab to create performance graphs.
   - Identify performance bottlenecks and take corrective actions.

## Benefits of Azure Monitor

1. **Centralized Monitoring**:
   - Consolidate logs and metrics from multiple resources in one place.
   - Simplify troubleshooting and diagnostics.

2. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Detect and respond to anomalies in real-time.
   - Optimize resource utilization and performance.

3. **Scalable and Flexible**:
   - Monitor resources at any scale, from small applications to enterprise-grade systems.
   - Customize metrics and logs to suit specific business needs.
